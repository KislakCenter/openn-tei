Hebrew MS 30,Compilation of texts on logic and astrology,"Hebrew MS 30/1 [ff.1a-2a]. Astronomical text. Scribe: Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan. Fragmentary text on solar and lunar eclipses (לקות) and related geometrical and astronomical phenomena. The title in green is hard to decipher and partially visible only, as follows: [...]  והשמשי ו[...]ן מולד אמיתי הירחי.|Hebrew MS 30/2 [ff.3a-5a]. Maqala fi sina'at al-mantiq. Scribe: Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan. Fragment (Chapters 6-7) only. For Moses ibn Tibbon's Hebrew translation of the work, entitled Millot ha-higgayon (מלות ההגיון, Treatise on Logic) see the next item in this manuscript. Herbert A. Davidson (in Moses Maimonides: The Man and his Works, OUP 2005) considers the ascription of the work to Maimonides, 1135-1204, as spurious. Language: Judeo-Arabic.|Hebrew MS 30/3 [f.8a]. Text on logic. Fragment of 13 lines only on three types of syllogism (הקש). Sefer Ibn Kaspi and Be'ur ha-temunah ha-rishonah mentioned on respectively lines 1 and 2. Text cut off in outer margin. Written by a different hand to that of Samuel ibn Danan.|Hebrew MS 30/4 [ff.9a-24b]. Millot ha-Higgayon, or Treatise on Logic. Translator: Moses ibn Tibbon, active 13th century. Scribe: Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan. Herbert A. Davidson (in Moses Maimonides: The Man and his Works, OUP 2005) considers the ascription of the work to Maimonides, 1135-1204, as spurious.|Colophon in Hebrew ending with an ornamental signature of the scribe.|Hebrew MS 30/5 [ff.25a-81b]. Tseror ha-Kesef, by Joseph Kaspi, ca. 1280-ca. 1340. Scribe: Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan.  This compendium in the field of logic condenses existing works on Aristotelian logic under sub-headings Porphyry's Isagoge, Sefer ha-Maʼamarot (ספר המאמרות), Sefer ha-Melitsah (ספר המליצה), Sefer ha-Heqqesh (ספר ההקש), Sefer ha-Mofet (ספר המופת), and so forth. Unsurprisingly therefore, the work carries in some manuscripts the secondary title Qitsur sifre ha-higgayon le-Aristo (קצור ספרי ההגיון לאריסטו) / Abridgment of books on Aristotle's logic. Kaspi relies heavily on Ibn Rushd, not least on the latter's Middle Commentary.|Colophon followed by an ornamental signature of the scribe.|Hebrew MS 30/6 [ff.82a-98a]. Perush Millot ha-Higgayon la-Rambam, or Commentary on Maimonides' Treatise on Logic. Scribe: Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan. The authorship of this treatise is insecure. It cannot be ascribed to Mordechai Comtino (15th cent.), who wrote a treatise with the same title. Perhaps the commentary was composed by the primary scribe of the manuscript, Samuel ibn Danan, in which case it would be an autograph version of his commentary. The text has been executed particularly colourfully.|Colophon in Hebrew ending with an ornamental signature of the scribe.|Hebrew MS 30/7 [ff.98b-102b]. Sha'ar ha-Shirtutin, or Chapter on Lines [on the Palm of the Hand]. Scribe: Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan. 98b-102b comprise several magical fragmentary texts. Strictly speaking, the title Sha'ar ha-shirtutin only seems to relate to folios 98b-100a. Afterwards the following sub-titles are found: Yedi'at ha-shirtut (Knowledge of Lineation, f.100a) and Inyan aher bi-yedi'at ha-shirtut (Knowledge of Lineation – Another Interpretation, f.101a). The texts on folios 98b-100a and 102a-102b concentrate on what the features of someone's fingers can say about their fortune in life. The text in the middle deals with fortune telling on the basis of reading the palm of the hand.|Hebrew MS 30/8 [f.103a]. Astrological text, by Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan [also scribe]. On the Hebrew and Arabic terminology for the seven planets (כוכבי On the Hebrew and Arabic terminology for the seven planets (לכת כוכבי) and the twelve zodiacal signs. Ibn Danan reports that he found the Arabic terms in an old book. He also refers to one of his teachers as a source of information.|Hebrew MS 30/9 [f.103b]. Texts on medicine and logic, by Samuel ben Sa'adiah ibn Danan [also scribe]. Two very short fragments. The first, entitled ן' סינה חשבון ?לחולים ?שתקן , deals very briefly with a simple calculation, the outcome of which is indicative of the expected outcome of a disease. Ibn Danan claims to know from experience that Ibn Sina's method works ( ן' סינה בדוק). In the second he returns one last time to the field of logic by listing the Hebrew and Arabic terminology for the ten categories.|Colophon in Hebrew ending with an ornamental signature of the scribe.","",Hebrew,heb,"",Fez
